            Charlie is truly a wonderful person to work with. As a teammate, he
            is supportive, positive, and solution focused. As a person focused
            on his growth and career, Charlie is a constant learner and
            ambitious, which I highly value in the people I work with. I was
            truly grateful to have him on our team at 321 and I look forward to

            Carlos is a fast learner and a great coworker. I worked with Carlos
            on several web projects and he solved problems efficiently and
            creatively. He's also a great guy and a joy to be around. I would
            love work with him again someday given the opportunity.

            If I had to define Carlos, I would say that he is someone who
            perseveres through obstacles and does not quit. Moreover, Carlos
            finishes whatever he sets himself to do. He is an accomplished
            individual that has the grit to achieve his goals. Mr. Caro is a
            charismatic, intelligent, focused, and resourceful man. He has
            excelled in academics and in his professional endeavors, and will
            undoubtedly embark in a successful career upon completion of his
            degree. Carlos is a natural communicator, too. I am confident Carlos
            will exemplify St. Thomas University's motto of "developing leaders
            for life." I recommend Carlos without reservations.

            Since working with Carlos, he has shown and provided nothing but
            sincere professionalism and maturity in all his work. His attention
            to detail ensures that all projects and assignments are completed in
            a timely manner and are correct. Carlos embodies the traits and
            attributes of a leader. With his positive attitude, superb customer
            service and willingness to lend a helping hand, I am honored and
            humble to have worked with him; and recommend him for any job
            position or title he decides to embark on. For any employer that
            would like to discuss further and in detail this recommendation for
            Carlos, I would be happy to do so. Please contact me.
